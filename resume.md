# Experience
### NSF Graduate Research Fellow
**University of Oregon** · *September 2022 – September 2025 · Hybrid*

- Developed Random Forest classification models in R using large, disparate simulation output to predict vegetation shifts across four 10,000 km² landscapes, achieving >80% accuracy and >85% AUC-ROC.
- Engineered geospatial features from satellite imagery via GEE and trained Random Forest regression models in R and Python to map 25 years of species-level forest change.
- Conducted model comparison and evaluation using resampling to calculate R2 and AUC-ROC or RMSE metrics to determine optimal model selection; tuned models through k-fold cross-validation and grid search to improve predictive performance.
- Employed Shapley values and variable importance metrics to identify key environmental drivers of vegetation change and used time-series analyses to track temporal trends.
- Created high-impact geospatial visualizations and figures using R, ArcGIS/QGIS, and Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop, communicating findings to diverse audiences at six national conferences.
- Secured $156,850 in competitive funding utilized for tuition, stipend and research travel.

### Geospatial Data Research Assistant
**Kent State University** · *August 2020 – August 2022 · Hybrid* 

- Acquired, cleaned, and integrated geospatial datasets from field surveys, satellite imagery and environmental sources to assess tree species regeneration.
- Performed geospatial and spectral analyses to evaluate reflectance differences across vegetation types, time and seasons using GEE and ArcGIS.
- Created clear, reproducible data visualizations and figures for five professional presentations and publications.

### Sustainability Analyst Intern
**Akron Zoological Park** · *August 2018 – August 2019*

- Conducted data collection, analysis, and visualization to support key projects for the zoo’s sustainability plan, identifying trends and opportunities for improvement.  
- Led a waste audit that reduced employee waste by an average of 50%, demonstrating a data-driven approach to improving operational efficiency and sustainability performance.
- Authored over 20 newsletters and reports, translating complex sustainability findings into clear, actionable recommendations for diverse audiences.
- Collaborated across all departments to design and launch outreach campaigns that successfully educated the **entire zoo staff**, as well as local elementary schools and the general public, on sustainability initiatives.
