# Experience
### NSF Graduate Research Fellow
**University of Oregon** · *September 2022 – September 2025 · Hybrid*

- **Developed and validated 48 Random Forest classification models** to predict vegetation shifts across four 10,000 km² landscapes, achieving an average accuracy of over 82% and an AUC-ROC of over 90%. This analysis helped identify key environmental drivers of change over a 280-year simulation period.  
- **Engineered and tuned regression models** to predict vegetation density, analyzing the relative importance of over 40 different variables including climate, disturbance type, and topography using Shapley values.  
- **Led data science projects using R** and its ***'tidymodels'*** and ***'ranger'*** packages and **Google Earth Engine’s Python API** and its ***'scikit-learn'*** package to process and analyze large and complex datasets.  
- **Conducted advanced statistical analysis in R** and created impactful visualizations using ***'ggplot2'***, **Adobe**, and **GIS software**, presenting results at six national conferences.
- **Utilized remotely sensed data** from Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine to create a 25-year time-series analysis on forest changes, predicting species-specific basal area trends.  
- Secured **$156,850** in research funding through competitive proposal writing and project scoping.

### Geospatial Data Research Assistant
**Kent State University** · *August 2020 – August 2022 · Hybrid* 

- **Built, cleaned and analyzed large geospatial datasets** integrating field and remotely sensed data, using **R and Google Earth Engine**.
- **Created clear, high-impact data visualizations and figures** for numerous professional presentations and publications, showcasing the ability to effectively communicate complex data insights.

### Sustainability Analyst Intern
**Akron Zoological Park** · *August 2018 – August 2019*

- **Conducted data collection, analysis, and visualization** to support key projects for the zoo’s sustainability plan, identifying trends and opportunities for improvement.  
- **Led a waste audit that reduced employee waste by an average of 50%**, demonstrating a data-driven approach to improving operational efficiency and sustainability performance.
- **Authored over 20 newsletters and reports**, translating complex sustainability findings into clear, actionable recommendations for diverse audiences.
- **Collaborated across all departments** to design and launch outreach campaigns that successfully educated the **entire zoo staff**, as well as local elementary schools and the general public, on sustainability initiatives.
