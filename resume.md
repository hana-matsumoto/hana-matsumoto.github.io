# Experience
### Geospatial Data Scientist / NSF Graduate Research Fellow
**University of Oregon** · *September 2022 – September 2025 · Hybrid*

- Designed and implemented geospatial analysis workflows to predict and map landscape-scale forest change using ArcGIS, R, Python and GEE.
- Built, tested and compared Random Forest classification and regression models to project and map tree presence and density.
- Conducted model comparison and evaluation using resampling to calculate R2 and AUC-ROC or RMSE metrics to determine optimal model selection; tuned models through k-fold cross-validation and grid search to improve predictive performance.
- Engineered and validated geospatial predictors from satellite imagery and topographic and environmental data, performing alignment, resampling, masking and aggregation across scales.
- Evaluated model behavior using variable importance and Shapley values to identify key drivers and spatiotemporal patterns behind forest change.
- Developed clear documentation, figures and maps to explain analytical methods and results to collaborators and external audiences (six national conferences, two peer-reviewed publications).
- Secured $156,850 in competitive funding, including an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

### Geospatial Data Research Assistant
**Kent State University** · *August 2020 – August 2022 · Hybrid* 

- Acquired, cleaned, and integrated geospatial datasets from field surveys, satellite imagery and environmental sources to assess tree species regeneration.
- Performed spatial and spectral analyses to evaluate reflectance differences across vegetation types, time and seasons using GEE and ArcGIS.
- Created clear, reproducible data visualizations and figures for five professional presentations and publications.

### Sustainability Analyst Intern
**Akron Zoological Park** · *August 2018 – August 2019*

- Conducted data collection, analysis, and visualization to support key projects for the zoo’s sustainability plan, identifying trends and opportunities for improvement.  
- Led a waste audit that reduced employee waste by an average of 50%, demonstrating a data-driven approach to improving operational efficiency and sustainability performance.
- Authored over 20 newsletters and reports, translating complex sustainability findings into clear, actionable recommendations for diverse audiences.
- Collaborated across all departments to design and launch outreach campaigns that successfully educated the **entire zoo staff**, as well as local elementary schools and the general public, on sustainability initiatives.
