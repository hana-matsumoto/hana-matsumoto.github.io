# Experience

## NSF Graduate Research Fellow  
**University of Oregon** · *September 2022 – September 2025 · Hybrid*  

- Developed and validated 48 Random Forest classification models to predict vegetation shifts across four 10,000 km² landscapes, achieving an average accuracy of over 82% and an AUC-ROC of over 90%. This analysis helped identify key environmental drivers of change over a 280-year simulation period.  
- Engineered and tuned regression models to predict vegetation density, analyzing the relative importance of over 40 different variables including climate, disturbance type, and topography using Shapley values.  
- Led data science projects using R and its **tidymodels** and **ranger** packages and Google Earth Engine’s Python API and its **scikit-learn** package to process and analyze large and complex datasets.  
- Conducted advanced statistical analysis in R and created impactful visualizations, presenting results at six national conferences.  
- Utilized remote sensing data from Landsat imagery and the Google Earth Engine to create a 25-year time-series analysis on forest changes, predicting species-specific basal area trends.  
- Secured **$156,850** in research funding through competitive proposal writing and project scoping.

## Geospatial Data Research Assistant  
**Kent State University** · *August 2020 – August 2022 · Hybrid*  

- Built and cleaned large geospatial datasets integrating field and remotely sensed data, using R and Google Earth Engine.  
- Created clear, high-impact data visualizations and figures for numerous professional presentations and publications.

## Sustainability Analyst Intern  
**Akron Zoological Park** · *August 2018 – August 2019*  

- Conducted data collection, analysis, and visualization to support key projects for the zoo’s sustainability plan, identifying trends and opportunities for improvement.  
- Developed clear, data-backed communications, including newsletters and reports, to translate sustainability findings into actionable recommendations.  
- Collaborated across operations and marketing teams to design outreach campaigns tied to sustainability performance.
