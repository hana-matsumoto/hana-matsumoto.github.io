Beyond creating narratives from data to make graphs and charts, I enjoy making maps in my free time.

I created these maps using a combination of different GIS, 3D modeling and editing tools such as ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Adobe Illustrator and PhotoShop, GIMP 3, Blender and Affinity.
Some tutorials and information I relied on quite a bit throughout the creation of these maps:
- [How to Make a 3D Map in Blender by Wesley Barr](https://wesleybarrgis.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/how-to-make-a-3d-map-in-blender/) - Blog post
- [How to Make Beautiful 3-D Georefernced Map using QGIS and Blender](https://www.youtube.com/live/R1g2pKIAXTs) - Video
- [Maps in Blender 3.5: Custom Height Maps (DEM) + Color Maps (Photoshop, No Plugins, Blender 3.5)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjIlrK2Ch9I&t=723s) - Video

While I am still improving my craft, check out some of my recent work below!
