Mt. Everest south base camp, Nepal

For my first successful 3D map, I designed this map for my friend for her birthday as she was hiking this trail up to the Mt. Everest south base camp as birthday present to herself (hi Liza). 

I used QGIS, Blender and Adobe Illustrator and PhotoShop to create this map. The basemap I used is actually an antique map produced by the Royal Geographical Society in cooperation with the Mount Everest Foundation and archived at [RareMaps](https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/95522/the-mount-everest-region-royal-geographical-society) and [University of Wisconsin Milwaukee's Digital Map Collection library](https://collections.lib.uwm.edu/digital/collection/agdm/id/30615/rec/2). I also considered using other maps from the [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/view/search?q=mt+everest&annotSearch=) which is another great resource for antique maps. The trail data I was able to find from a user on [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1R6MkAXWvhvvywV6huHq0AnoEeWPkxvNI&ll=27.855285993962884%2C86.803691868863&z=11). I downloaded this as a KML and edited it using both ArcGIS Pro and later PhotoShop. The basemap along with the trail was place ontop a 90 m Copernicus DEM - Global and European Digital Elevation Model in Blender.

For my first 3D map, I was happy with how it turned out. However, I wish I would have rescaled the DEM to get rid of some of the boxy-ness/pixelation of the map. This is something I improved upon in my map of Emma Lake.
