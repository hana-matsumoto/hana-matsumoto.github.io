Emma Lake in British Columbia, Canada
![Emma Lake in British Columbia](/assets/images/EmmaLake_BC.png "Emma Lake in British Columbia")

I created this map for my friend's partner's birthday (hi Alex and Sam). Emma Lake is a special place, nestled in the coast range of British Columbia near Powell River. With the located picked out by my friend and armed with some text she wanted included, I came up with this design.

To create this map I created a true color composite image using 10 m Sentinel imagery in ArcGIS Pro. I overlayed this composite on top of a 30 m DEM from Natural Resources Canada's [Medium Resolution Digital Elevation Model of Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/18752265-bda3-498c-a4ba-9dfe68cb98da) in Blender which I rescaled and resampled. Map projection is WGS 1984 UTM Zone 10N.
