### About
I grew up and went to undergrad in Ohio and am a big Cleveland sports fan!

When I am not sitting behind the computer, you can find me hiking, camping, snowboarding or enjoying several episodes of a show series I have seen already.

I have the two cutest cats in the world named Cuchara and Momo.
